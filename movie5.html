        <p id="p1" style="color:brown">A large chunk of the Shippuden plot also involves Naruto believing he must save his brother-figure, Sasuke Uchiha. Both characters clash, ideologically and physically. Sasuke's preferred element is lightning, which generates iconic imagery when the two square up for a battle of wind against lightning; it's the perfect storm. Whether they are friend or foe, Naruto and Sasuke serve as foils to one another, and even share a literal yin and yang dynamic. Perhaps the most iconic power they combine is the Six Paths of Yin and the Six Paths of Yang. The imagery of two forces united is similar to two cyclone clouds converging, or more aptly, a hurricane. Not only does Shippuden harken to Naruto and Sasuke's united power, but it highlights the duality of their stormy relationship and epic journey into adulthood, together. So, with this deeper analysis, Naruto: Shippuden can be interpreted or translated as, "the swift growth of the legend of Naruto." And what a perfect, all-encompassing title it is.</p>
